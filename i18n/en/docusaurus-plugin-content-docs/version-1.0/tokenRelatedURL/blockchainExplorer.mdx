By presenting an Etherscan URL, we can get the transaction history of an item and show it to the user.

You can get the transaction history of an item, including the `TxHash` using `SDK.getItemLogs()`.


The `NetworkId` for each item can be referenced by `Item.networkId`.

## Etherscan

For those with the `NetworkId` as `1` or `4`, the below URL can be used.
